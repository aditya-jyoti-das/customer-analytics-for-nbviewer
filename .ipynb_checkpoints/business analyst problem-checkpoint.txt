Step 1: Market Analysis-
The objective here is to assess the market size and growth potential in both regions. We would start by gathering data from market research reports to understand current market sizes and growth forecasts. Additionally, we'll analyze prevailing trends, such as the increasing demand for organic products or shifts towards online shopping, using visual aids like graphs and maps to highlight these markets.

Step 2: Competitive Landscape-
We would identify the main competitors in these markets and evaluate Nykaa’s market positioning relative to them. This involves listing major beauty retailers in both regions and using pie charts to display market shares, alongside visual representations of competitor logos.

Step 3: Product Comparison-
Here, our focus would shift to comparing Nykaa’s product offerings with those of existing competitors. We'd discuss the range and exclusivity of our products and highlight our unique selling propositions. Side-by-side images or checklists would be used as visual aids to make these comparisons clear.

Step 4: Financial Analysis-
This step involves estimating the financial implications of market entry. We'd outline the costs associated with setup, marketing, and operations, and project potential earnings to discuss the return on investment. Simple bar charts would be useful here to visually compare initial costs against potential revenues.

Step 5: Regulatory and Logistical Review-
We'd examine the regulatory and logistical challenges expected in these regions. This includes discussing major legal hurdles and supply chain and distribution challenges, using icons or brief clips to represent regulatory bodies and logistics like trucks and warehouses.

Step 6: Final Recommendation-
Based on our comprehensive analysis, I would conclude with a strategic decision, recommending whether Nykaa should expand into Western Europe or Southeast Asia. This decision would be backed by a summary of key reasons drawn from our analysis, and I'd use a balance scale graphic to visually present the pros and cons that led to our final decision.
